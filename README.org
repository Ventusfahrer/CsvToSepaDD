#+TITLE: PyCsvToSepa -- A simple CSV to SEPA XML converter
#+AUTHOR: Michael Fiedler <dev@michael-fiedler.net>

This project aims to create a very simple converter from CSV to SEPA XML.
This is very helpful if using complex finance software comes with too much
bloat for simple tasks such as administering the finance stuff of a small
club, requiring electronic interaction with a bank for obtaining membership
subscriptions via SEPA Direct Debit once a year.
